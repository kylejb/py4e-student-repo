## Chapter 02 | Exercise 04

# Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17 
height = 12.0

# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

# "//" is an integer division function; the number is rounded down (i.e., floored) to nearest integer
1. width//2 == 8 (int)
2. width/2.0 == 8.5 (float)
3. height/3 == 4.0 (float)
4. 1 + 2 * 5 == 11 (int)

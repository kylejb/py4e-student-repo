## Chapter 12, Section 11 | Exercise 03
"""
Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of:

(1) retrieving the document from a URL, 
(2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and 
(3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. 

Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.
"""

import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error

url = input("Enter URL: ")
fhand = urllib.request.urlopen(url)


character_count = 0
document = list()

for line in fhand:
    if len(line) < 1:
        break
    # print(line.decode().strip())
    line = line.decode().strip()
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        character_count += len(line)
        document.append(word)

#  Print the first 3,000 characters from retrived document over HTTP
## QUESTION: How do I print characters rather than words? As written, I think the way to approach this is to convert the list into string. Is there a better way?
print("Total number of characters:", character_count)
